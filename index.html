                    <h2>We Make The Dream A Reality</h2>
                    <p id="descriptives ">We 've all been there: in desperate need of a blighted box, no time to do all the necessary handiwork and definitely too afraid to seek out the local Wyrd Womyn, Wood Witch or Wizard to fill our boxy rush job with the appropriate maledictions.
                        That's where we can help. Need a little something special for that special someone? Not sure what to get the guy who has everything? Looking to make some unforgettable moments? Look no further!</p>

                    <h2>Craftsmanship. Quality. Timeless Style</h2>
                    <p id="descriptives ">Nowadays, just about anyone can produce just any old box. <em>(Looking at you, cardboard!)</em> We at Pandora's, however, pride ourselves on craftsmanship. We manufacture each of our boxes to the most exacting standards. Each box is hand-fangled using the rarest and most fragrant of driftwoods and the richest
    Corinthian leather. If you're looking for evils and woes that will really make an impact, look no further! Our on-staff, extremely jealous and petty deities produce only the finest and most baroque in curses and hexes (jinxes performed on request
    for a small additional fee).

            <h2>The Ghastly Gift That Keeps On Giving</h2>
            <p id="descriptives">Perhaps you're saying to yourself, "I really could use a handy hoodoo cube, but I'm worried about really wrecking things permanent-like." We at Pandora's, we've been there, and we hear you. We offer you hope. That's right, in keeping with
                long-standing tradition, we offer the inclusion of Hope at the bottom of each and every blasted box at NO EXTRA CHARGE. You won't find an offer like that at a price like this without a time machine or an interdimensional portal!
